# trumpless
A chrome plugin that replaces articles on major news websites with something else. My motivation was to point out how much attention we're giving Trump plus the added bonus of not seeing any articles. +1 for political ignorance! Anyways..

The plugin supports a number of news websites including (list may not be up to date):
* BBC 
* CBC
* Guardian
* NYT 
* Atlantic
* NPR
* Slate
